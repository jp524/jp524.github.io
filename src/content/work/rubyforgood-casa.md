### Overview

I'm a contributor to Ruby for Good's CASA project. CASA stands for Court Appointed Special Advocate. Volunteers act as CASA on behalf of youth in their county's foster care system.

The [CASA web application](https://casavolunteertracking.org/) is used by three regional chapters. Volunteers use the application to track their CASA cases (foster youth) and supervisors review the work done by volunteers across various cases.

The CASA project is a large Ruby on Rails codebase that has been developed since 2020 with the help of 300+ contributors.

### Selected Contributions

- Reduced occurences of flaky tests in Docker environment from 30-50% down to less than 10%
- Allow supervisors and administrators to view their volunteer's learning jours
- Update case contact form UI
